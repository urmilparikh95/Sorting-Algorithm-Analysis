# Sorting-Algorithm-Analysis

This program is a test analysis of 3 major sorting algoritms - insertion sort, merge sort and heapsort. Also the Sort utility of java is taken into consideration. Runtime and Key Comparison analysis is done for the algorithms which are executed on different types of input - sorted, reverse sorted and random. Graphs are generated for better visualization.
### Steps for Execution
prerequisites: A linux (or Unix based) machine, jdk8, python3, R, bash interpreter.  
1. Clone the repo. Go to the Project Directory.  
2. run ```./sample_run_script.sh```  

You can see the output in .out files and graphs in Rplot.pdf.  
Note: Execution of the script can take time as the input size is huge. Its a slow process, unless you have a supercomputer!!
